## Global Design & UX Direction
- Dark-mode foundation with deep purple-to-black gradient backgrounds and neon violet accents for primary CTAs.
- Bold sans-serif typography for headlines (e.g., 72–96px hero, 48px section headers); lighter-weight body copy for readability.
- High contrast call-to-action buttons: primary `Launch Your Voice Agent` in neon purple; secondary buttons outlined in soft white.
- Use full-width sections with subtle motion graphics (e.g., flowing waveforms, particle gradients) to convey AI dynamism.
- Modular card layout for features, use cases, and plans—rounded corners, glassmorphism overlays on dark backgrounds.
- Incorporate micro-animations: hover effects on cards, animated waveform in hero, scrolling marquee for logos.
- Accessible color contrast, generous whitespace, sticky top navigation.
